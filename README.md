# Useful code snippets for Face Reconstruction and Rendering
This repo integrated [Deep3DFaceRecon_pytorch](https://github.com/sicxu/Deep3DFaceRecon_pytorch) and [PIRender](https://github.com/RenYurui/PIRender) for easy end-to-end inference.

The original vico-challenge [code](https://github.com/dc3ea9f/vico_challenge_baseline) is not easily adaptable for [end-to-end evaluation](https://github.com/dc3ea9f/vico_challenge_baseline/issues/17) due to the disconnect between the main part, face reconstruction part and render part. In this repo, I have refractor them for ease of use.

***Note:*** This repo is still under development and may have bugs (except [example.py](./example.py))
